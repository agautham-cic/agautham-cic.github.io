Hello,

I recently (Sep-Oct 2025) had a course on Strategic Management and Competitive Intelligence, offered by Prof. [Daniel Rouach](https://escp.eu/rouach-daniel) and Prof. [https://escp.eu/santi-patrice] at the ESCP Business School, Paris campus. The course was an introduction to the field of Competitive Intelligence - an introduction on it, its history and inception, theoretical basis, practical application and value creation for businesses. Refer to [this](https://www.agautham.io/strategy/2025/10/17/competitive-intelligence-course.html) to get a sneak peek into the course structure and contents. The two professors have started [The Competitive Intelligence Center](https://competitiveintelligencecenter.com/) at ESCP in partnership with the [Tel Aviv University](https://ims.tau.ac.il/Tal/Syllabus/Syllabus_L.aspx?course=1242326901&year=2024). The CIC platform provides access to a number of excellent resources like structured course content on CI, interesting books, research publications and articles.

The Decision Loop, the name of this platform is inspired from the OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act), a framework developed for decision making by military strategist and researcher John Boyd. This platform is geared towards being an important resource center for the fields of Competitive Intelligence, Strategic Management and Decision Making. Intention is to create, curate and publish different types of content like blog posts, interviews with experts, book summaries, case studies and anything related to these fields.

If you want to write an article, do an expert interview or contribute to The Decision Loop in any manner, feel free to contact me via email: (adwaith_venkatesh.gautham@edu.escp.eu).

Cheers!
